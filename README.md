# Bicycle-project

## Backend part of bicycle project

- This is a project in the course Application Development at NTNU Ã…lesund. 
- Our goal is to make a functional backend with
all the things needed. This includes general things like handling customers, products and orders. 
- This project taught us how to make a backend for a website. 
- There is still room for improvement, but we now have a backend with different functionalities and a good security.
